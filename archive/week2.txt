Title. The Ranch Rant Episode 2 - Goulart Gets Spicier

1. Breaking: Wade Cleared of All Charges, Gets the Girl’s Digits?

Yo, fam, it looks like Wabeybaby just pulled off the ultimate finesse of the century. Remember the chaos last week with the Canine Chaos Duo and the Brazilian girl? Yeah, well, in a plot twist that feels like it came straight outta a telenovela, Wade was absolved of all crimes, thanks to the power of chill vibes and some next-level diplomacy.

Word is, the Brazilian fam was like, “Psh, it’s all good, fam! No hard feelings.” And just like that, the drama evaporated quicker than your ex’s apology. But get this—sources are now saying that Wabeybaby somehow scored the Brazilian girl’s number! Yeah, you heard me right—man went from potential felon to sliding into her DMs like a pro. Rumors are swirling, and the Goulart gossip is HOT right now. Is she Wabeybaby’s future Mrs. Ranch Road? We’re on the edge of our seats, folks. Keep your eyes peeled, ‘cause wedding bells might just start ringing in 2025.

2. Joey D: The Legend Moves Back to Hawaii

Brace yourselves, Goulart Ranch—we’ve got a devastating plot twist. Joey D, honorary Goulart Ranch legend, the man who could shotgun a beer faster than a TikTok challenge and surf any couch you throw at him, is packing his bags and moving back to Hawaii. Bruh, Joey D leaving is like the sun deciding to peace out and leave us all in the dark.

The man, the myth, the legend, is returning to his island roots. Why? Well, rumor has it that Joey’s been vibing with the aloha spirit, and honestly, no one can blame him. But let’s keep it 100, Goulart Ranch won’t be the same without Joey D’s shenanigans. His going-away party is already shaping up to be a legendary send-off. Wabeybaby’s dogs might even behave this time (no promises). We’re talking full island vibes, coconuts, Hawaiian shirts, and probably enough BBQ to feed a small nation. If you’re not there, what are you even doing with your life?

3. BFair Plans Largest Halloween Bash in the Hemisphere

Hold onto your pumpkins, fam — BFair, our local Zen-breathing king, has officially lost his chill. Word just dropped that he’s in the planning stages of the largest Halloween bash this side of the freakin’ hemisphere. Think about that for a second. The entire hemisphere. Forget your basic pumpkin spice lattes and cute costumes. BFair is bringing full-on chaos energy to Goulart Ranch this October.

Rumor has it, he’s got everything from giant inflatable spiders to a DJ booth that lights up like a Vegas nightclub. We’re talking costumes so fire, they might set off the ranch’s sprinklers. And y’all know BFair—he doesn’t do anything half-hearted. We might even see fire dancers. Skeletons doing the electric slide. Fog machines that’ll make you feel like you stepped into a horror movie where the plot is just "vibe or die." The entire ranch is shook. Get ready, because this is gonna be the kind of party that goes down in history—borderline illegal in 17 states, no cap.

4. Friends Attempt to Slow Down – But Can They?

After last week’s Fast & Furious situation, Wabeybaby’s homies are making a noticeable effort to slow down. Like, they're actually out here trying, fam. Word on the street is some of them even removed their speed limit blockers (whatever those are) and have been spotted cruising at a reasonable 40 mph. Big step for the ranch’s wannabe Vin Diesels.

One local was heard saying, “Yo, it’s actually kinda nice not to have to dive into the bushes every time a car comes by.” But like, let's be real—how long will this last? If you know the Goulart Ranch boys, you know they’re one TikTok challenge away from hitting Mach speed again. Stay tuned for next week’s reckless driving chronicles.

5. Local Chatter: Girls on the Street Catching All the Attention

Finally, we gotta talk about the serious uptick in chatter from the Goulart boys. Apparently, the cute girls walking around the ranch have the boys out here acting like they’ve never seen a human before. Every corner you turn, you hear someone saying, “Yo, did you see her? Bro, she was looking mad fine.” One local even said, “Bruh, it’s like they’re casting for a runway show out here.”

The gossip game is so strong right now, you could cut it with a butter knife. It’s like the boys suddenly discovered the concept of flirting, and they’re fully sending it. Whether anything comes from all this chatter remains to be seen, but if the rumors are true, expect some pretty cringe-worthy pickup attempts from the crew. Fingers crossed no one gets roasted too hard.

Stay spicy, stay ridiculous, and always keep it 100 on Goulart Ranch Road.
